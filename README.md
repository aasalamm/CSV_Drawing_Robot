# CSV_Drawing_Robot

## Overview
This project requires a CSV file input with coordinates to points in the drawing. One a file is chosen, the drawing is plotted and the coordinates are passed into an Inverse Kinematics solver to find the angles the motors need to be. This happens for each coordinate until the drawing is complete
